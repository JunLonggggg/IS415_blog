```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Getting Started

This code chunk performs three tasks:

- Create a list of R packages needed
- Install packages that does not exist in the system
- Run the packages within the packages list

```{r echo =TRUE,eval=TRUE}
packages <- c('sf', 'tidyverse') #packaging list
for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){ #T = True
    install.packages(p)
  } 
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```
